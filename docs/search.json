    "text": "The Mining Law, as amended, opened the public lands of the United States to mineral acquisition by the location and maintenance of mining claims.\nMineral deposits subject to acquisition in this manner are generally referred to as “locatable minerals.” Locatable minerals include both metallic minerals (gold, silver, lead, copper, zinc, nickel, etc.) and nonmetallic minerals (fluorspar, mica, certain limestones and gypsum, tantalum, heavy minerals in placer form, and gemstones).\nStarting in 1873, the Department of the Interior began defining locatable minerals as those minerals that are:\n\nrecognized as a mineral by the standard experts,\nare not subject to disposal under some other law, and\nmake the land more valuable for mining than for farming.\n\nMinerals normally locatable on lands acquired (purchased or received) under the Acquired Lands Act of 1947 by the United States or found on Indian reservations are subject to lease only (43 CFR Group 3500).\nCode of Federal Regulatoins Link\nSince 1920, the Federal government has leased fuels and certain other minerals, charging a royalty on the value of the mined and sold material. Today, minerals that are subject to lease include oil and gas, oil shale, geothermal resources, potash, sodium, native asphalt, solid and semisolid bitumen, bituminous rock, phosphate, and coal.\nBureau of Land Management Link\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal law governing locatable minerals is the Mining Law of 1872 (May 10, 1872), which declared all valuable mineral deposits in land belonging to the United States to be free and open to exploration and purchase. This law provides citizens of the United States the opportunity to explore for, discover, and purchase certain valuable mineral deposits on federal lands that are open for mining location and patent (open to mineral entry).\n\n\n\nThis law provided for the leasing of minerals from public lands including oil, gas, coal and other non-energy leasable minerals such as phosphates and sodium. It requires that a royalty be paid on amounts mined and sold.\n\n\n\nThis law provides for the disposal of mining materials on public lands, both saleable and leasable. Under this Act, some “common variety” minerals, such as sand and gravel, are subject to sale as opposed to rents and royalties.\n\n\n\nThis law declares that it is the continuing policy of the federal government to foster and encourage private enterprise in the development of a stable domestic minerals industry and the orderly and economic development of domestic mineral resources. This act includes all minerals, including sand and gravel, geothermal, coal, and oil and gas.\n\n\n\nStock Raising Homestead Act (SRHA) lands are different from other federal lands in that the United States owns the mineral estate, but not the surface estate. Patents issued under the SRHA and Homestead Act entries patented under the SRHA reserve the mineral estate to the United States along with the right to enter, mine, and remove any reserved minerals that may be present in the mineral estate. The law allowed a settler to claim 640 acres of non-irrigable land that had been designated by the Secretary of the Interior as “stock raising” land. Mineral exploration was beginning to escalate and the Federal government opted to maintain the mineral rights to the land claimed under this law.\n\n\n\nThis Act did not amend the 1872 law, but did affect the recordation and maintenance of claims. Persons holding existing claims were required to record their claims with the BLM, and all new claims and sites were required to be recorded with the BLM. The law gave the BLM information on the location and number of unpatented mining claims, mill sites, and tunnel sites; helped determine the names and addresses of current owners; and helped remove any cloud of title on abandoned claims.\n\n\n\n\nThe minerals on Federal lands are divided into three categories, each subject to different laws and regulations.\n\n\nMinerals which are subject to the Mining Law of 1872, as amended, include gold, silver, copper and other hard rock minerals. This law allows U.S. citizens the opportunity to explore for, discover, and purchase certain valuable mineral deposits on Federal lands that are open for mining claim location (open to mineral entry).\nMore information: link\n\n\n\nMinerals such as coal and a host of other commodities, are subject to various Mineral Leasing Acts.\n\n\n\nMinerals such as sand and gravel that are essential to construction and road building, are subject to the Materials Act of 1947, as amended.\nMore information: link\n\n\n\n\nThe Mining Law of 1872, as amended, is the major Federal law governing locatable minerals. This law allows U.S. citizens the opportunity to explore for, discover, and purchase certain valuable mineral deposits on Federal lands that are open for mining claim location (open to mineral entry).\nThese mineral deposits include most metallic mineral deposits and certain nonmetallic and industrial minerals. The law sets general standards and guidelines for claiming the possessory right to a valuable mineral deposit discovered during exploration.\n\n\nA mining claim is a parcel of land for which the claimant has asserted a right of possession and the right to develop and extract a discovered, valuable, mineral deposit. This right does not include exclusive surface rights (see Public Law 84-167).\nThere are three basic types of minerals on federally-administered lands: locatable, leasable, and salable. Mining claims are staked for locatable minerals on public domain lands.\nState Requirements\nProvisions of the Mining Law allow for the development of local rules that are consistent with federal law. Therefore, individual states can have their own manner of locating and recording mining claims\n\n\n\nLode Claims\n\n\nDeposits subject to lode claims include classic veins or lodes having well-defined boundaries. They also include other rock in- place bearing valuable minerals and may be broad zones of mineralized rock. Examples include quartz or other veins bearing gold or other metallic minerals and large volume, but low-grade disseminated gold deposits. Descriptions are by metes and bounds surveys beginning at the discovery point on the claim and including a reference to natural objects or permanent monuments. Federal statute limits their size to a maximum of 1500 feet in length, and a maximum width of 600 feet (300 feet on either side of the vein).\n\n\nPlacer Claims\n\n\nPlacer Claims - Placer claims are defined as “…including all forms of deposit, excepting veins of quartz, or other rock in-place.” In other words every deposit, not located with a lode claim, should be appropriated by a placer location. Placer claims, where practicable, are located by legal subdivision (aliquot part and complete lots). The maximum size is 20 acres per locator, and the maximum for an association placer is 160 acres for 8 or more locators. The maximum size for a corporation is 20 acres per claim. Corporations may not locate association placer claims unless they are in association with other locators or corporations as co-locators.\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal statute does not describe what constitutes a valuable mineral deposit, therefore the government has adopted the “prudent man rule.” This rule determines value based on whether a person will consider investing time and money to develop a potentially viable mineral deposit. The U.S. Supreme Court approved this definition in 1905.\nSince that time, the definition has evolved to include the need to show that the mineral could be mined, removed, and marketed at a profit. The U.S. Supreme Court concurred with this definition in 1968. The marketability test supplements the prudent man rule and considers deposit economics and market entry. The claimant is required to show a reasonable prospect of making a profit from the sale of minerals from a claim or a group of contiguous claims.\nMore information: link\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA bond is a financial guarantee, given to provide assurance to one party that another party will fulfill an obligation it has undertaken to perform. Under a bond, the principal on a personal bond is responsible to fulfill a contractual obligation. If the principal does not perform the contractual obligation, the bond may be collected. The operator on the notice or plan must be the principal (obligor) on the bond. If the principal is not the operator, then a bond rider is required to cover operations conducted by the operator.\nThe BLM and many states require a surface management bond on all so-called “3809 notices and plans of operation,” which are those governed by the 43 CFR Subpart 3809. These regulations require anyone intending to develop mineral resources on the public lands to prevent unnecessary or undue degradation of the land and reclaim disturbed areas. To guarantee this you must file a bond. You may be able to file a joint bond to demonstrate that the operator/principal is bound to the United States and the state where you plan to operate. In those cases, the financial instrument must be payable to the United States and the state. Check with you local BLM office and your state government for specific guidance.\n\n\nA corporate surety bond consists of a promise by a principal and surety to the United States that the surety will correct any default should the principal not do so, paying up to the limits of the amount of the bond. A surety bond is a three-way contract between the principal, the surety, and the United States (and the State in the case of joint bond).\nWhen filing a joint bond with the BLM, the Surface Management Surety Bond form (Form 3809-1) must be used. Check with your state for forms that it may require.\n\n\n\nThe principal may furnish a personal bond in lieu of a surety bond to ensure compliance with all the terms and conditions of a plan of operations on public land.\nThe BLM accepts three financial forms of personal bonds: Cash Bond, Letter of Credit (LOC), and Certificate of Deposit (CD). The BLM Surface Management Personal Bond form (Form 3809-2) must accompany the financial instrument."

Arizona’s public lands also provide a good source for salable minerals, such as sand, gravel, stone, and clay, permitting over 2 million tons worth over $2 million annually."
